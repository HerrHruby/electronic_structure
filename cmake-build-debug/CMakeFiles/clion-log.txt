CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:11 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindArb.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Arb", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Arb" with any of
  the following names:

    ArbConfig.cmake
    arb-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Arb" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "Arb_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Arb" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
