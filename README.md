# electronic_structure
A program to perform electronic structure calculations

Implements the Hartree Fock algorithm, and uses the Mcmurchie Davidson Algorithm to compute molecular integrals.

Currently uses STO-3G basis sets only.

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

TODO: Improve architecture to allow for different basis sets. UHF, ROHF. MP2 and othe post-Hartree Fock methods. Symmetry package to further increase molecular integral calculation speed?
